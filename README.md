## Installation

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation

In this project, I analyzed the listing prices in different neighborhoods in Seattle to provide an overview of listing prices and total listing during the year. To help potential Airbnb host to price their listing, I developed this prediction tool to estimate your listing price based on your location and room type. 

These datasets include the information of the host, property list, and listing information throughout the year. The three business questions that I focused on in this analysis are:

1.	What are the differences in listing prices among different neighborhoods?
2.	How do listing prices change during the year?
3.	How should you price your listing based on location and room type?

## File Descriptions

## Licensing, Authors, and Acknowledgements
For this analysis, I analyzed the data from the Airbnb website in 2016. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the [Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle). Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
