# Seattle AirBNB Pricing Tool

As the real estate market continuing soaring during this global pandemic, are you thinking about investing in an apartment and renting it out as Airbnb in Seattle? Or are you considering renting out your spare room in your house to get some extra cash? This tool is for you! 

I analyzed the listing prices in different neighborhoods in Seattle and provided you an overview of listing prices and total listing during the year to help you decide the optimal location and listing time for your Airbnb. To make it even simpler, I developed this prediction tool with a Machine Learning algorithm for you to estimate your listing price based on your location and room type. With this tool, you can ensure your listing price is reasonable and competitive; in the meanwhile, it will generate the maximum profits for you!  

For this analysis, I analyzed the data from the Airbnb website in 2016. [Data source](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle) 

These datasets include the information of the host, property list, and listing information throughout the year. The three business questions that I focused on in this analysis are:

1.	What are the differences in listing prices among different neighborhoods?
2.	How do listing prices change during the year?
3.	How should you price your listing based on location and room type?
